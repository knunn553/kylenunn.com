Hello, I’m Kyle Nunn and I’m a computer scientist. Currently, I’m 24 years young.
In 50 years, I will be looking down on the tech world with a smile, looking down on the impact I have made as well as peering down onto the creative innovations being made by the younger generations.
Please join me on my journey!
